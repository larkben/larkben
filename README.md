- 👋 Hi, I’m @larkben
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and blockchain. I would really like to learn the language Scala and become a devloper.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ in college and focusing on learning object orientated programming (OOP).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects with peers at my college and perhaps create some base ground framework for a web based app for my college campus.
- 📫 How to reach me just send me an email at spartinofarrows@gmail.com, if project becomes serious you will move up to my personal email.
